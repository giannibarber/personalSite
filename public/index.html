        <p>Hi, I'm Gianni.</p>

        <p>I'm a product manager turned engineer. Until September of 2022 I worked as a product manager at <a href="https://www.gethorizon.net/">Horizon</a>. Since then I studied software engineering through <a href="https://launchschool.com/employers">Launch School</a>. In 2024, I teamed up with other awsome engineers I met in Launch School to build <a href="https://data-loaf.com">DataLoaf</a>, an open-source, self-hostable product analytics platform.</p>

        <p>I'm curious about software that helps us think and defends our privacy. When I'm not working, I enjoy reading (primarily science fiction and non-fiction about tech, psychology and philosophy), listening to music, and spending time with my friends.</p>

        <p>If you would like to contact me the best way is by <a href="mailto:personalsite.unchain294@passmail.net">email</a>. You can also connect with me on <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/giannibarber">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
